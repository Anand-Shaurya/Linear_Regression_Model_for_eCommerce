# E-commerce Client Analysis with Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project is meant purely for educational purposes. The dataset we use here is fictional and 
serves as a training set. In our scenario, an online retailer wants to determine whether they 
should invest more resources into improving their mobile app or their website. Our goal is to help 
them make an informed decision using data.

## What Does the Data Contain?
The data weâ€™re working with comes from a test dataset [hosted on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 
It includes information about e-commerce customers such as:

- **Avg. Session Length**: Typical duration of in-store style guidance sessions
- **Time on App**: Average time spent within the mobile app (minutes)
- **Time on Website**: Average time spent on the website (minutes)
- **Length of Membership**: Number of years the user has been a registered member

Please note that any personal information in the dataset is fictitious.

## Project Objective
We aim to fit a linear regression model to predict how much customers might spend annually. By 
examining factors like session length, time on the app, time on the website, and membership length, 
we hope to identify where the company should direct its efforts to maximize sales.

## How to Use This Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` or in the notebook).
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to follow the data exploration, feature analysis, and model training 
   steps.
